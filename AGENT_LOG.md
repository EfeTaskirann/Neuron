## 2026-04-28T19:27:40Z WP-W2-02 completed
- sub-agent: general-purpose
- files changed: 8 (`src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, `src-tauri/migrations/0001_init.sql`, `src-tauri/src/db.rs` (new module, 244 lines incl. 5 tests), `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` (setup hook + manage pool + register health_db), `src-tauri/src/commands/mod.rs` (new), `src-tauri/src/commands/health.rs` (new, smoke command), `src-tauri/.sqlx/query-976b52de…json` (offline cache), `Cargo.lock`)
- commit SHA: `8870de6`
- acceptance: ✅ pass — orchestrator independently re-ran the gates after sub-agent return
  - `cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml -- db` → exit 0, **5/5 tests passing**:
    - `migration_creates_all_eleven_tables` — list matches expected sorted set
    - `pragma_foreign_keys_is_on_per_connection` — verified across 3 connections
    - `migrations_are_idempotent` — second-launch + fresh-pool, exactly 1 row in `_sqlx_migrations`
    - `pool_can_insert_and_select` — round-trip via the agents table
    - `macro_query_uses_offline_cache` — `sqlx::query_scalar!` compiles + runs against `.sqlx/`
  - `cargo check` → exit 0, 0.70s warm
  - 11 schema tables present in `0001_init.sql`: agents, edges, mailbox, nodes, pane_lines, panes, runs, runs_spans, server_tools, servers, workflows
  - `.sqlx/` offline cache committed (1 query JSON for the test macro)
  - DbPool wired via `app.manage(pool)` in `lib.rs` setup hook; smoke command `health_db` returns `{ tables, foreignKeysOn }`
  - prototype isolation: `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD` shows zero `Neuron Design/` / `neuron-docs/` / `app/` / `docs/` files touched
  - frontend regression check: `pnpm typecheck` ✅, `pnpm lint` ✅, `pnpm test --run` ✅ (still 1 file 2 tests — Hello Neuron + OKLCH)
  - manual `pnpm tauri dev` + `sqlite3 .tables` verification: pending — sandbox cannot launch desktop window
- naming deviation (transparent): smoke command exposed as `health_db` (underscore) instead of charter-canonical `health:db` (colon). Reason: Tauri 2.x's `#[tauri::command]` does not ship a stable `rename = "..."` attribute without extra crates; per WP-W2-02 explicit allowance the underscore form is acceptable for this WP only. WP-W2-03 introduces `tauri-specta` binding generation which will alias the IPC surface back to colon-namespaced names.
- informational: actual Tauri bundle identifier is `app.neuron.desktop` (set in WP-W2-01's `tauri.conf.json`) — DB file lands at `%APPDATA%\app.neuron.desktop\neuron.db` on Windows, NOT the WP body's example `com.neuron.dev`. WP body comment was illustrative; behaviour follows the actual identifier.
- toolchain: `sqlx-cli` installed via `cargo install sqlx-cli --no-default-features --features sqlite` (one-time, on user PATH; not a project dependency)
- branch: `main` (local; not pushed)
- next: WP-W2-03 (Tauri command surface) — depends on WP-W2-02 only

## 2026-04-28T18:26:30Z WP-W2-01 completed
- sub-agent: general-purpose
- files changed: 19 (key: `app/{package.json,vite.config.ts,vitest.config.ts,index.html,tsconfig*.json,eslint.config.js}`, `app/src/{main.tsx,App.tsx,App.test.tsx,styles.css,test/setup.ts,vite-env.d.ts}`, `src-tauri/{Cargo.toml,build.rs,tauri.conf.json,src/{main.rs,lib.rs},capabilities/default.json,icons/}`, root `{package.json,pnpm-workspace.yaml,Cargo.toml,Cargo.lock,pnpm-lock.yaml,.nvmrc,.gitignore,.cargo/config.toml}`)
- commit SHA: `d0bbffa`
- acceptance: ✅ pass — orchestrator independently re-ran all 4 non-interactive gates after sub-agent return
  - `pnpm typecheck` → exit 0 (`tsc -b --noEmit`)
  - `pnpm lint` → exit 0 (`eslint --max-warnings=0`)
  - `pnpm test --run` → exit 0 (1 file, 2 tests: "Hello Neuron" render + `--background` OKLCH token assertion)
  - `cargo check --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml` → exit 0 (0.60s on warm cache)
  - prototype isolation: `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD` shows zero `Neuron Design/` or `neuron-docs/` files touched
  - manual `pnpm tauri dev` window-open verification: pending — sandbox cannot open desktop window; user must verify
- deviation from sub-agent file allowlist: `.cargo/config.toml` added (out-of-allowlist). Reason: this Windows host has a partial MSVC + KitsRoot10 registry mismatch causing `cargo check` to fail with `LNK1181: oldnames.lib / legacy_stdio_definitions.lib` despite both libs existing in alternate directories. The config.toml adds project-local `/LIBPATH` rustflags using 8.3 short paths so cargo can compile Tauri's Win32 dependency tree end-to-end. Sub-agent disclosed transparently in its report; orchestrator accepts the deviation as project-local, Charter-compatible (no new tech, no global state mutation), and necessary to reach the WP's `cargo check exits 0` acceptance gate on this host.
- toolchain bootstrap performed by sub-agent: `pnpm@10.33.2` via `npm i -g`, Rust `1.95.0 stable` via `rustup-init` (minimal profile). Both placed `cargo`/`pnpm` on user PATH.
- branch: `main` (local; not pushed)
- next: WP-W2-02 (SQLite schema + migrations) — depends on this WP only

## 2026-04-28T17:30:54Z docs/review-2026-04-28 completed
- sub-agent: orchestrator-direct (manual route per SUBAGENT-PROMPT § "Notes for the orchestrator" — docs-only pass, sub-agent delegation overhead skipped)
- files changed: 4 (1 added: `docs/adr/0006-event-naming-and-mailbox-realtime.md`; 3 modified: `docs/work-packages/WP-W2-01-tauri-scaffold.md`, `docs/work-packages/WP-W2-03-command-surface.md`, `docs/work-packages/WP-W2-08-frontend-wiring.md`)
- commits (in order): `8d61b75`, `9b24047`, `8024b5d`
- acceptance: ✅ pass — 3 commits in correct order, 4 files diff against `main`, working tree clean, all `Co-Authored-By` trailers present, no files outside `docs/` touched
- branch: `docs/review-2026-04-28` (local; not pushed)
- next: orchestrator awaits user confirmation to merge `docs/review-2026-04-28` → `main` and proceed to WP-W2-01 delegation
