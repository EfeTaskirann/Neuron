## 2026-04-28T18:26:30Z WP-W2-01 completed
- sub-agent: general-purpose
- files changed: 19 (key: `app/{package.json,vite.config.ts,vitest.config.ts,index.html,tsconfig*.json,eslint.config.js}`, `app/src/{main.tsx,App.tsx,App.test.tsx,styles.css,test/setup.ts,vite-env.d.ts}`, `src-tauri/{Cargo.toml,build.rs,tauri.conf.json,src/{main.rs,lib.rs},capabilities/default.json,icons/}`, root `{package.json,pnpm-workspace.yaml,Cargo.toml,Cargo.lock,pnpm-lock.yaml,.nvmrc,.gitignore,.cargo/config.toml}`)
- commit SHA: `d0bbffa`
- acceptance: ✅ pass — orchestrator independently re-ran all 4 non-interactive gates after sub-agent return
  - `pnpm typecheck` → exit 0 (`tsc -b --noEmit`)
  - `pnpm lint` → exit 0 (`eslint --max-warnings=0`)
  - `pnpm test --run` → exit 0 (1 file, 2 tests: "Hello Neuron" render + `--background` OKLCH token assertion)
  - `cargo check --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml` → exit 0 (0.60s on warm cache)
  - prototype isolation: `git diff HEAD~1 HEAD` shows zero `Neuron Design/` or `neuron-docs/` files touched
  - manual `pnpm tauri dev` window-open verification: pending — sandbox cannot open desktop window; user must verify
- deviation from sub-agent file allowlist: `.cargo/config.toml` added (out-of-allowlist). Reason: this Windows host has a partial MSVC + KitsRoot10 registry mismatch causing `cargo check` to fail with `LNK1181: oldnames.lib / legacy_stdio_definitions.lib` despite both libs existing in alternate directories. The config.toml adds project-local `/LIBPATH` rustflags using 8.3 short paths so cargo can compile Tauri's Win32 dependency tree end-to-end. Sub-agent disclosed transparently in its report; orchestrator accepts the deviation as project-local, Charter-compatible (no new tech, no global state mutation), and necessary to reach the WP's `cargo check exits 0` acceptance gate on this host.
- toolchain bootstrap performed by sub-agent: `pnpm@10.33.2` via `npm i -g`, Rust `1.95.0 stable` via `rustup-init` (minimal profile). Both placed `cargo`/`pnpm` on user PATH.
- branch: `main` (local; not pushed)
- next: WP-W2-02 (SQLite schema + migrations) — depends on this WP only

## 2026-04-28T17:30:54Z docs/review-2026-04-28 completed
- sub-agent: orchestrator-direct (manual route per SUBAGENT-PROMPT § "Notes for the orchestrator" — docs-only pass, sub-agent delegation overhead skipped)
- files changed: 4 (1 added: `docs/adr/0006-event-naming-and-mailbox-realtime.md`; 3 modified: `docs/work-packages/WP-W2-01-tauri-scaffold.md`, `docs/work-packages/WP-W2-03-command-surface.md`, `docs/work-packages/WP-W2-08-frontend-wiring.md`)
- commits (in order): `8d61b75`, `9b24047`, `8024b5d`
- acceptance: ✅ pass — 3 commits in correct order, 4 files diff against `main`, working tree clean, all `Co-Authored-By` trailers present, no files outside `docs/` touched
- branch: `docs/review-2026-04-28` (local; not pushed)
- next: orchestrator awaits user confirmation to merge `docs/review-2026-04-28` → `main` and proceed to WP-W2-01 delegation
